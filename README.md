## Overview

- You can check the demo [here](https://checkoutpagechallenge.netlify.app/).
- This project really challenged my HTML and CSS skills so much. It really helps me change my ways when styling so I could easily manage styling when in desktop and mobile mode with ease with reduce number of lines of code by using :root pseudo-class to set global css variables to reduce/avoid redundancy (at least). I also learned that to attain the design you want, you need to structure your html properly.
